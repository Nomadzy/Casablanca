## Tools
<!--#### Head Tracking, skinning..-->
#### General
* DCS Updater: As its name implies, this tool is responsible of keeping your installation fresh, but not only, it can also repair a corrupt installation and change the current installed version. This tool is included with DCS install and is launched every time you start DCS. If it get corrupted by it self, ou can get it [here](http://updates.digitalcombatsimulator.com/files/DCS_updater_64bit.zip). [Documentation](https://forums.eagle.ru/showthread.php?t=114030).

* [DCS Updater/Launcher GUI](https://forums.eagle.ru/showthread.php?t=160053): This unofficial power tool by SkateZilla, is a more user-friendly frontend for the included DCS Updater. It is intended for users doing more than regular updates. You can use it to manage multiple installations of different versions of DCS in the same machine, Launch VR ON/OFF, Manage configurations, Manage modules ..

* [OvGME](https://wiki.hoggitworld.com/view/OVGME): OvGME is mod manager, it main purpose is to provide an easy way to import and enable mods for games then restore original files when disabling mods. OvGME works by comparing the game file tree with the given mod file tree, then identifies what files to replace, create and save as backup.

* [Tacview](https://www.tacview.net/):  This tool let you understand what really happened during your last flight. It is a universal flight data analysis tool which enables you to easily record, analyze and understand any flight to improve your skills much faster than with conventional debriefings. It is widely used by simers and airforces.

* [Combat Flite](https://www.combatflite.com/): This tool offers the possibility to make advanced missions with elaborate tooling. It let you export mission files, merge them, export briefing data packs, and generate kneeboards.

* [LotATC](https://www.lotatc.com/): This is a non free client + server software for DCS, that provide users to get an ATC/GCI view of the battle. Basically, its an AWACS software. It let you play the role of a tactical or air traffic controller and provide help to human pilots so that they better accomplish their missions, by radioing them a picture or guidance instructions. It is compatible with SRS and UniversRadio (see below).

#### Communication
While on multiplayer users can communicate with each other trough text, audio chat is key in the heat of the action. And although DCS comes nowadays with voice chat, most people tend to use stand-alone VoIP software.

* [DCS Simple Radio Standalone](http://dcssimpleradio.com/gettingstarted/) (SRS): This open source software aims to provide easy to use and realistic communication in DCS Multiplayer. The radio integrates into all exiting and future aircraft available in DCS. Servers can configure SRS to be more or less realistic – enforcing realistic line of sight and distance limitations or allowing aircraft to always hear each other.

* [Teamspeak](https://www.teamspeak.com/en/): This application enables audio communication between users on a chat channel, much like a telephone conference call. The client software connects to a TeamSpeak server of the user's choice, from which the user may join chat channels. This software is free for up to 32 users per server.

* [UniversRadio](https://tacnoworld.fr/universradio/): This software interacts with both TeamSpeak and aircarft radois in DCS, allowing users to communicate through simulated radio channels and frequencies. UniversRadio’s algorithms simulate distance and altitude effects between emitter and receiver, relief masking, frequency used, range, modulation (AM/FM), encrypting and power of radio transmitter to accurately render radio communications.

* [Discord](https://discord.com/): This platform specializes in text, image, video and audio communication between users in a chat channel. Contrary to SRS and Teamspeak, the server is hosted in the company's data-centers, you can access it either by installing the app, or in a navigator window.

#### Cockpit extraction
For most of us, one screen or a VR headset is all we need for total immersion. But for a happy few, having the RWR, UFC and MFDs on a secondary(quaternary ?) screen/touch screens is the way to go.

* [Helios](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/fr/files/3302014/) is a virtual cockpit simulator for DCS.  It let you create virtual cockpits, which allow you to increase your immersion. Profiles can be created or downloaded to allow you to simulate MFDS, switches, knobs, gauges and more complex instruments which can then be mapped into DCS to give a much improved experience. Many people use a touch screen monitor with their virtual cockpits but it is also possible to run the cockpit on a remote PC/Laptop. [Have a look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQG0dJMROg).

* [Capt Zeen profiles](http://www.captzeen.com/helios/profiles.asp) Going to use Helios ? perfect, Capt Zeen offers an impressive library of Helios profiles for the major modules with the corresponding DCS monitor config.

* [Harrier AV-8B profile](https://github.com/BlueFinBima/DCS-AV-8B-NA-Profile) for Helios.

* [Ikarus](https://github.com/s-d-a/Ikarus) is a solution for virtual cockpits for DCS like Helios. With it you can be display many gauges of aircrafts and helicopters using [DCS ExportScript](https://github.com/s-d-a/DCS-ExportScripts).

* [DCS Interface](https://github.com/charlestytler/streamdeck-dcs-interface) for [StreamDeck](https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/stream-deck) is a plugin that allows you to create buttons and interfaces that update with DCS events. There are currently three settings for each Streamdeck button you create.

* [DCSFlightpanels](https://github.com/DCSFlightpanels/DCSFlightpanels) primary use is for using [Saitek/Logitech panels](https://www.logitechg.com/en-gb/products/flight.html) and [Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/stream-deck) in DCS. Together with DCS-BIOS you can manage every control for the aircraft and use the Radio Panel to operate cockpit radio equipment and also show data from the aircraft in the Multipanel & Backlit Panel. You can use multiple panels of each type and configure them separately. It also supports [SRS](http://dcssimpleradio.com/gettingstarted/).

* [aInstruments](http://lumatek.sk/aInstruments/index.html) is a paid Android tablet or phone app that show aircraft instruments from DCS. It also shows kneepad pages and SAMs threat pages. It can automaticaly dial GPS coordinates from map on Hornet or Harrier UFC as waypoint or as JDAM, JSOW targets on Hornet. Server part runs on computer where DCS World is installed and [client part runs on your Android device](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sk.lumatek.aInstruments).
