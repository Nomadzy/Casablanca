This tool is included with DCS install and is launched every time you start DCS.

* [DCS Updater/Launcher GUI](https://forums.eagle.ru/showthread.php?t=160053): This unofficial power tool by SkateZilla, is a more user-friendly frontend for the included DCS Updater. It is intended for users doing more than regular updates. You can use it to manage multiple installations of different versions of DCS in the same machine, Launch VR ON/OFF, Manage configurations, Manage modules ..

#### Communication
While on multiplayer, users can communicate with each other trough text, audio chat is key in the heat of the action. And although DCS comes nowadays with voice chat, most people tend to use stand-alone VoIP software.

* [DCS Simple Radio Standalone](http://dcssimpleradio.com/gettingstarted/) (SRS): This open source software aims to provide easy to use and realistic communication in DCS Multiplayer. The radio integrates into all exiting and future aircraft available in DCS. Servers can configure SRS to be more or less realistic â€“ enforcing realistic line of sight and distance limitations or allowing aircraft to always hear each other.

* [Teamspeak](https://www.teamspeak.com/en/): This application enables audio communication between users on a chat channel, much like a telephone conference call. The client software connects to a TeamSpeak server of the user's choice, from which the user may join chat channels. This software is free for up to 32 users per server.

* [Discord](https://discord.com/): This platform specializes in text, image, video and audio communication between users in a chat channel. Contrary to SRS and Teamspeak, the server is hosted in the company's data-centers, you can access it either by installing the app, or in a navigator window.
